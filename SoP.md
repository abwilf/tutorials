If you're reading this, it's probably because you've asked me to review your statement of purpose for grad school. If so, I'm of course happy to – consider this doc my initial advice, and reach out if you have any questions or want me to read over more drafts :)

Also, I'm not a professor so take this with a grain of salt! Professors are probably the best ones to review your SoP.

## What is the purpose of a Statement of Purpose?

First I'll correct a misconception some may have (I know I had it). A SoP is *not* a college essay or an award / fellowship app. In a lot of those essays, the goal is to tell your personal story, and to tell it convincingly. You're painting a picture of you – why you're interesting, well rounded, and deserving of recognition / a spot in a community. A great essay for those introspects on you – what drives you, what kinds of life experiences you've had...etc. The reader is attempting to understand you, your goals, your ambitions, and what brought you here.

A SoP is different. Yes, your character is important, but more than anything that will be spoken to by your recommenders and evaluated in your interview. The goals, as I see them, of a SoP are very simple, and slightly different. You want to convince the reader that

(1) You have an *exciting research vision*, and
(2) You are the right person to carry out that research vision

In my experience, *almost all first drafts* spend 90% of thought, time, and editing on (2) and only 10% on (1). I think that balance should be *way more* towards the former, perhaps 60-70% on (1).

Here's why this is so important. You should assume the "reader" is the professor you want to work with – not some nebulous collection of academics. Oftentimes your intended advisor's voice is the one that matters most in reviewing your application. Convince them, and you have a good shot.

Imagine you're this professor. You are *super* busy. You're reviewing a *tall* stack of applications, and you have to narrow down to a manageable list of top prospects you'll interview. Unfortunately, each essay you read starts with the same first paragraph (I'm simplifying here): "ever since I was a child, I have dreamt of researching -- your field --. I have worked my whole life to get here, excelling at every test and personal project along the way. Coming to -- your university -- is the next step in my journey."

There are two main problems with that essay:
- It's hard to separate from the pack: most people write that essay, and the competition is stiff – a lot of them have done impressive things.
- More importantly, it doesn't address what the professor is really looking for. Your professor has a research agenda, and they want to see "how well will this student fit into my research agenda?" Part of the purpose of the SoP is to *show them that you think about their field in a new and interesting way*. They want to see your perspective on the work they care about. If you start with personal stuff about you, you'll lose them. 
- So, think hard about (1) – you may benefit from your mentors' advice here – and fill in (2) around it.

## How do you write one?
Basically, the structure I'd recommend is as follows:
- Intro
	- your bold vision for the future of the field: here's where I think the field should head and here are the 2-3 core challenges for us to get there
		- e.g., (paraphrasing) Automatic code generation is exciting and has many implications on the world if we can get it to work. Code generation systems still struggle with long sequence lengths, reliability, and generalization. Long sequence lengths are an incredibly important problem b/c often codebases are millions of lines long – how can modern transformers, whose memory scales quadratically with sequence length, contribute to large codebases? I think we can solve this by ...etc. Reliability is also an issue...etc. 
	- I'm the best person to do this b/c my experiences & skills with a b and c prepare me well.
- paragraph 1: core challenge number 1
	- description of the challenge, substantiating why this important for the field to solve, and giving some intuition on how we'll get there. This is *key* – it shows your research vision and excites the prof. More importantly, it shows them how you're thinking about the field, which they care about, instead of asking them to care about your life story. No offense meant :)
		- e.g., Long sequence lengths are particularly challenging for transformers, including code-gen models. Sparse transformers offer promise but have limitations, retrieval can be good but is difficult with domain specificity. I propose a research direction that investigates *automatic search* – building models that can understand *when, where, and how* to search for relevant context and manage their context window content dynamically. Here's why this is a cool approach & relates well to prior approaches...etc.
	- *why you're well suited to solve this challenge*: this is where you introduce personal experience. The best format is to refer to a paper you worked on where you solved something very similar. At the very least, you should be able to point to skills that you learned along the way that will be essential.
		- great e.g., I wrote this paper that directly addresses this challenge. --brief description of the paper and the main findings, along with any impressive results & stuff you did for it, as well as what you learned-- This experience made me excited and prepared me well for future work on this direction.
- paragraph 2 & 3: same thing, with core challenges 2 & 3
- paragraph 5: connect this to the professor. I want to work with --prof name-- b/c of their work on --these core challenges & research direction--. Make sure to find someone really relevant!

## Pitfalls to avoid
- talking about your personal experience too much, or too soon. (1) is the key: that gets the reader in the door. A good rule of thumb is that if you don't excite them (1), they won't absorb anything about (2).
- Making your research vision too broad or too narrow. You should start with a broad, exciting statement of where the field can go in 15 years, then describe specific needs & challenges, the gap with previous research, and how you would contribute. See the "tangent" below.
- I'll add more here as I read more SoP's :)

### Tangent on "Hook, Need, Gap, Contribution"
- It's a simple formula but it takes time to figure out how to do it well. Go read a bunch of paper intros with that in mind, and start to see what those are to get a feel for how people structure academic arguemnts. Here's an example:
- "hook" gets them interested: e.g., code generation systems are cool & would be a huge win for humanity
- "need": we need code generation to be reliable and interpretable b/c ...
- "gap": current code gen systems have difficulty with reliability as shown here and here and interpretability as shown here and here. Work has tried to solve this by doing x y and z but still fails to reach the goal
- "contribution": here's what we do
